# 9269-Tutorials-Ninja-Hackathon
# Tutorials-Ninja Website Automation Testing
## Project Title : Tutorials-Ninja

## Introduction :
  The goal of this testing cycle was to verify the functionality, usability, performance, and responsiveness of the Thirsty Wine website. Automated tests were carried out using Cypress     with the Page Object Model (POM) for functional validation, while manual testing focused on  non-functional aspects like user experience and cross-browser compatibility.

## Project Type :
  This project focuses on both manual and automated testing of the Thirsty Wine website's frontend. It emphasizes the use of the Page Object Model (POM) for structuring automation tests in Cypress, ensuring maintainability and reusability. The testing covers functionality, usability, and cross-browser/device compatibility, with BDD Cucumber used for clear test specifications.

## Deployed App :
