# Tutorials-Ninja Website Automation Testing
## Project Title : Tutorials-Ninja

## Introduction :
  The goal of this project is to test the functionalities of the Tutorials Ninja web application. This document serves as a high-level test planning document, outlining the scope, test strategy, test schedule, resource requirements, test deliverables, and schedule. The testing will be conducted using Selenium for automation, Cucumber for behavior-driven testing, and Page Object Model (POM) for organizing the code. Additionally, manual testing will be performed for exploratory and usability testing.

## Project Type :
  This project focuses on both manual and automated testing of the Tutorials-Ninja website's frontend. It emphasizes the use of the Page Object Model (POM) for structuring automation tests in Selenium, ensuring maintainability and reusability. The testing covers functionality, usability, and cross-browser/device compatibility, with BDD Cucumber used for clear test specifications.

## Deployed App :
